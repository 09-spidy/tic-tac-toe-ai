## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed. You will also need the `pygame` library.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
python runner.py
### 3. Understanding the AI (Minimax)
Since you've successfully implemented the Minimax algorithm, your AI is mathematically unbeatable. It works by creating a "game tree" of every possible move to ensure it always chooses the path that leads to a win or a draw.


---

### Next Level: Alpha-Beta Pruning
If you notice a small delay when the AI makes its first move, it's because it's checking thousands of possible outcomes. You can make it instant by adding **Alpha-Beta Pruning**, which tells the AI to stop exploring a branch as soon as it finds it's worse than a previously seen move.

**Would you like me to provide the updated `tictactoe.py` code with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make your AI lightning-fast?**
